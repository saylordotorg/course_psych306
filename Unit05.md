**Unit 5: The Auditory System** <span id="5"></span> 
*We will now turn to the auditory system. We will begin by discussing
the complexity of the sound stimulus, noting that sound comes in many
forms (think of music, speech, and other complex sounds), all of which
our brains are capable of understanding. You will learn the properties
of sound, and discover how these properties relate to what we hear. We
will also review the biology of the ear, identifying different pathways
of the brain that enable us to hear.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 17 hours to complete.

**5.2.1 The Ossicles: Malleus, Incus and Stapes** <span
id="5.2.1"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 5.2 covers this
subunit. These smallest bones in the body are truly a miracle of

*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 5.2 covers this
subunit. Consider the effect of the incorrect operation of the ossicles.

    Lecture
    Notes”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Psych306-Reading-5.5.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Click the link above to navigate to the web page and
    read “Section 1: Loudness.” Do not be concerned if some of the links
    to figures and illustrations do not work. NOTE: This reading applies
    to all subsections of section 5.5.  
        
     Terms of Use: The material has been hosted with the kind permission
    of Professor Lera Boroditsky.

**5.5.1 Firing Rate Hypothesis** <span id="5.5.1"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 5.5 covers this subunit. In
some ways, the idea of neural firing rate as a perceptual signal is an
issue for the perception of both pitch and loudness. Make sure that you
understand how it relates to both pitch and loudness perception.*

**5.5.2 Number of Neuron Hypothesis** <span id="5.5.2"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 5.5 covers this subunit. If
firing rate doesn*’*t do the job of signaling loudness, should we
perhaps look to the raw number of neurons that are stimulated?*

**5.5.3 Critical Bands and Band-Limited Noise** <span
id="5.5.3"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 5.5 covers this subunit. As
you read this section, think about why we refer to band-limited auditory
stimuli as *“*noise.*”

**5.5.4 The Zwicker Loudness Matching Experiments** <span
id="5.5.4"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 5.5 covers this
subunit. According to Zwicker, what is the relationship between loudness
and the total energy stimulating the basilar membrane?*

**5.5.5 Neural Code for Pitch and Loudness** <span id="5.5.5"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 5.5 covers this
subunit. This reading summarizes how we think pitch and loudness
perception actually work. It is critically important to understand the
mechanisms of each.*

**5.5.6 Adaptation and Damage** <span id="5.5.6"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 5.5 covers this subunit. As
you read this section, are you aware of the sound of the air
conditioning or heating fan in the room? Does the computer you are using
make any kind of hum? What does it mean if ambient sounds that we are
unaware of go unnoticed until we pay attention to them?*

**5.6.1 Monaural Cues** <span id="5.6.1"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 5.6 covers this subunit. One
of the reasons we have more than one ear is to enrich our ability to
perceive sound *“*in space.*”* It helps us localize sounds, for example.
Is it possible to receive cues about things like sound localization with
only one ear?*

**5.6.2 Binaural Cues** <span id="5.6.2"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 5.6 also covers this
subunit.*
