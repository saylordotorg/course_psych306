Course Syllabus for "PSYCH306: Sensation and Perception"
--------------------------------------------------------

Sensation and perception are the processes by which we absorb
information from environmental stimuli and convert it into data that our
brains and bodies use to modify behavior. This course will introduce you
to these two closely related, though distinct, processes. We will begin
with sensation, the physical process by which we use our sense organs
(i.e. tongues for taste or noses for smell) to respond to the
environmental stimuli around us. Perception, on the other hand, refers
to our interpretation of stimuli. It occurs through cognitive processing
and enables us to use information in order to change our behavior. While
these processes may seem simple, they are just the opposite: large
portions of the brain are devoted to the seemingly straightforward
processes of seeing and hearing, and entire sensory organs have
developed in order to facilitate them. Further, while the brain is
constantly using the information it gathers to make decisions, we are
entirely unaware of this activity. Unbelievably, studying illusions is
one of the easiest ways to learn about how we process stimuli
(especially visual stimuli). We will accordingly devote a substantial
amount of time to illusions later in this course. In this course, you
will not only learn how we use sensation and perception to understand
the world around us, but identify the ways in which these processes can
fail. We will take a close look at how we use specific behaviors in the
presence of certain stimuli by learning about the biology of both the
hearing system and the visual system (we will learn, for example, how
the visual system measures light, how it sees color and motion, and how
it recognizes distinct objects). We will conclude with a discussion of
how the other senses (smell, taste, and touch) affect perception.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:  
  

-   describe the sensory systems;
-   distinguish between sensation and perception;
-   explain how sensory and perceptual processes shape our experience of
    “reality;”
-   explain the basic principles of classical psychophysics;
-   explain how sensation and perception relate to cognition;
-   explain how human sensory systems respond to energy in the physical
    environment (i.e. light waves, air pressure, chemical molecules,
    etc.), transforming it into a perceptual experience that the brain
    can understand (i.e. sight, sound, smell, etc.);
-   compare and contrast the major theoretical perspectives on sensation
    and perception, including direct perception, indirect perception,
    and the information processing perspective;
-   compare and contrast the five sensory systems in terms of their
    sensory/anatomical setup and perceptual organization;
-   explain the roles of evolution, development, society, prior
    knowledge, and inference in our perceptual judgments and our
    conscious experiences;
-   identify and define the leading terms, concepts, theoretical
    perspectives, empirical findings, and historical trends in the study
    of sensation and perception;
-   compare and contrast psychological principles, theories, and methods
    as they pertain to sensory and neurological systems;
-   critically read, understand, and evaluate scientific literature,
    understand and use scientific and technical vocabulary, and
    synthesize information from multiple sources.
