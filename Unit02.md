**Unit 2: Psychophysics** <span id="2"></span> 
*The term “psychophysics” refers to the methods and techniques that
researchers use when studying sensation and perception. This field is
unique in that researchers rarely have directly accessible, hard
evidence with which to work. Take, for example, the following question:
“Is the color I think of as green the same color that others think of as
green?” The researcher will have to come up with some unique research
methods to find an answer to this highly subjective question. This unit
will take a close look at psychophysics and its methodologies.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 10.5 hours to complete.

     Instructions: If you have installed the JAVA plug-in (see page \#2
    of this course), clicking the embedded link will open a page
    displaying a black, white, and grey “grating.” The grating is a
    series of dark and light vertical bars displayed across your
    computer screen. Click the text link “Instructions” in the upper
    left corner and follow the directions. As you increase the size of
    the movement with the slider at the bottom of the page, it should be
    easier for you to detect the horizontal movement of the grating.
    Keep doing this until you get a good feel for the relationship
    between your accuracy and the degree of movement you are trying to
    detect.

    There are 25 trials, and please continue the experiment until the
    program provides your results in graphical form on the last page.
    You should see that your accuracy increased with the size of the
    difference in movement of the two gratings. This is a basic
    discrimination experiment.

     Instructions: Click the link above or the link on page \#16 of the
    “Chapter 2” PDF document for the embedded activity called
    “Experiment 2.x: Magnitude Estimation.” If you have installed the
    JAVA plug-in (see page \#2 of this course), clicking the embedded
    link will open a page where you need to make a number of settings
    choices. Click the text link “Instructions” in the upper left corner
    and follow the directions. Please be patient; psychophysical methods
    require many trials. You may repeat the demonstration with different
    settings as many times as you like.
