**Unit 3: The Visual System: Sensory Mechanisms** <span id="3"></span> 
*Earlier in this course, we spoke generally about different sense organs
and the ways in which researchers can test them. We will now take a
closer look at one of the most important sensory systems: vision. In its
simplest terms, the eye translates light information into the complex
pictures we see. The visual system includes the structures and processes
that underlie our interaction with much of the world around us. Under
normal circumstances, most of us consider vision our *“*primary*”* sense
modality. With this in mind, we will first discuss the reception of
visual information (sensation). The subsequent unit will cover how we
use visual information once it has been received (perception).*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 25.5 hours to complete.

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   explain the basic properties of the visual stimulus (light);
-   explain the important visual sensory structures and their
    function(s);
-   identify and describe the differences between visual sensation under
    low and normal light intensity levels; and
-   identify the basic visual sensory pathways in the central nervous
    system.
