**Unit 4: The Visual System: Perceptual Mechanisms** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, we will look at how humans are able to see and interpret
complex stimuli like color, motion, and multiple dimensions. Note that
not all animals are capable of seeing these stimuli; the human ability
to do so has been instrumental in our evolution. Over the course of this
unit, keep in mind what you have learned about the different aspects of
our visual pathways, asking how they might play a role in the
interpretation of these stimuli.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 20.5 hours to complete.

**4.3.1 What is Motion: Change in Position over Time** <span
id="4.3.1"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.3 covers this
subunit. Motion has direction and speed. Additionally, we can classify
motion according to type. Be sure to review the various types of motion
carefully.*

**4.3.2 Simple Translation** <span id="4.3.2"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.3 covers this
subunit. This type of motion has to do with the
simple *“*picture*”* that arrives at your retina.*

**4.3.3 Complex vs. Apparent Motion** <span id="4.3.3"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.3 covers this subunit. As
the name suggests, apparent motion is not really motion at all. Be sure
to consider why such phenomena help us understand motion perception.*

**4.3.4 Stroboscopic Motion** <span id="4.3.4"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.3 covers this
subunit. This kind of motion also is not *“*real*”* motion. Can you
imagine a world in which we could not experience stroboscopic motion?*

**4.3.5 Aftereffects of Motion** <span id="4.3.5"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.3 covers this subunit.
Understand why watching movement in one scene can lead to the perception
of movement in another, static scene.*

**4.3.6 Optic Flow** <span id="4.3.6"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.3 covers this
subunit. Optic flow is about how images move across your retina as you
move through the world. You should understand how this helps
us *“*navigate*”* through our daily lives.*

**4.3.7 Induced Movement** <span id="4.3.7"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.3 covers this
subunit. Have you ever felt like you were moving when the car next to
you began to move? What does this phenomenon suggest about our
perception of movement?*

**4.3.8 Object Motion** <span id="4.3.8"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.3 covers this subunit. Not
all motion perception involves the movement of objects, but this is
still one of the major features of how we perceive movement.*

**4.4.1 Motion Detectors in the V1** <span id="4.4.1"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.4 covers this
subunit. This portion of the reading covers the cortical processing of
movement by detector cells in the primary visual cortex.*

**4.4.2 Directionally-Selective Receptors** <span id="4.4.2"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.4 covers this subunit. Be
sure to watch the linked movie (see the link *“*movie*”* in section 2)
for a demonstration of motion aftereffect.*

**4.4.3 The Extrastriate Area and Pattern Cells** <span
id="4.4.3"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.4 covers this
subunit. Area MT in the extrastriate contains movement-sensitive cells
called pattern cells. Follow the various links in section 3 for
additional information and demonstrations.*

**4.4.4 Extrastriate Area and Motion Aftereffects** <span
id="4.4.4"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.4 covers this subunit. Not
all motion perception involves the movement of objects, but this is
still one of the major features of how we perceive movement.*

**4.4.5 Observer Motion: Relative Motion to Observer** <span
id="4.4.5"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.4 covers this subunit.

landing a plane.*

**4.4.6 Changing Light Pattern in the Retina** <span id="4.4.6"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.4 covers this
subunit. J.J. Gibson had an interesting perspective on the perception of
movement. Try to integrate this with our earlier discussion of
Gibson*’*s ideas about sensation and perception.*

**4.4.7 Eye Movements** <span id="4.4.7"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.4 covers this subunit. Be
sure you understand why it is important that our eyes move almost
continuously.*

**4.4.8 Corollary Discharge** <span id="4.4.8"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.4 covers this subunit. Be
able to answer the following question: Although our eyes are almost
constantly moving, how do we perceive a basically steady world?*

**4.5.1 From 2-D Images to a 3-D Construction** <span
id="4.5.1"></span> 
*Note: The reading and assignment assigned beneath subunit 4.5 cover
this subunit. See especially section 1, which introduces the concept of
depth as a perceptual phenomenon.*

**4.5.2 Monocular and Binocular Information** <span id="4.5.2"></span> 
*Note: The reading and assignment assigned beneath subunit 4.5 cover
this subunit. Is it possible to perceive depth if you have vision in
only one eye? Be sure you are able to address this question.*

**4.5.3 Depth Clues** <span id="4.5.3"></span> 
*Note: The reading and assignment assigned beneath subunit 4.5 cover
this subunit. Not all motion perception involves the movement of
objects, but this is still one of the major features of how we perceive
movement.*

**4.5.4 Disparity: The Different Views of our Eyes** <span
id="4.5.4"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.5 covers this subunit. How
does the fact that each of our eyes has a slightly different view of the
world provide information on depth? What do you see when you close first
one eye and then the other?*

**4.5.5 Uncrossed vs. Crossed Disparity** <span id="4.5.5"></span> 
*Note: The reading and assignment assigned beneath subunit 4.5 cover
this subunit. The reading covers this topic about halfway down on page
\#8.*

**4.5.6 Correspondence Problems: Diplopia and Binocular Rivalry** <span
id="4.5.6"></span> 
*Note: The reading and assignment assigned beneath subunit 4.5 cover
this subunit. Sometimes the images the brain receives from the two eyes
do not "merge" properly. See page \#10 of the assigned reading.*

**4.5.7 Stereovision in the Brain** <span id="4.5.7"></span> 
*Note: The reading and assignment assigned beneath subunit 4.5 cover
this subunit. This perceptual phenomenon is referred to
as *“*stereopsis*”* in the assigned reading, and is covered starting on
page \#7.*

**4.6.1 Early Models: Template Matching and Feature Analysis** <span
id="4.6.1"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.6 covers this subunit. See
section 1 for a general discussion on these early models of object
recognition.*

**4.6.2 Geon Theory** <span id="4.6.2"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.6 covers this
subunit. This is not about a race of aliens from Star Trek! Researchers
view geons as combinations of the basic *“*building blocks*”* necessary
for object recognition.*

**4.6.3 Single-Model Axis, Component Axes and 3D Model Match** <span
id="4.6.3"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.6 covers this subunit. Be
sure to understand the assumptions and limits of these ideas about
object recognition.*

**4.6.4 View-Dependent Recognition** <span id="4.6.4"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.6 covers this
subunit. This idea is that object recognition depends on the context. It
is easier to recognize an object in a familiar context as opposed to a
novel context. Think about your own experiences as you read about this
idea.*

**4.6.5 Gestalt Theories and Perceptual Organization** <span
id="4.6.5"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.6 covers this subunit. The
Gestalt idea is that you cannot separate the *“*parts*”* from
the *“*whole.*”* When we look at a wooded mountainside, we see the
forest first, and not the individual trees. According to the Gestalt
(German for *“*the whole*”*) view, the relationship between the parts
guides our perception of the whole.*

**4.6.6 Is Facial Recognition Special? The Importance of Familiarity**
<span id="4.6.6"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.6 covers this
subunit. There is good evidence suggesting that humans are *“*hard
wired*”* to recognize faces. Think about whether you have observed this
in infants and small children.*

**4.6.7 Agnosias: Impaired Recognition** <span id="4.6.7"></span> 
*Note: The reading assigned beneath subunit 4.6 covers this subunit. As
always, perceptual failures can help us discover
how *“*normal*” *perception works. Think about what the various agnosias
might tell us about object recognition.*
