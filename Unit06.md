**Unit 6: Smell, Taste, and Touch** <span id="6"></span> 
*In this unit, we will discuss the three remaining senses: smell, taste,
and touch. Though we will only spend one unit on these three senses,
each is complex and important; however, we use them less frequently than
sight and sound. This unit will discuss the ways that taste, smell, and
touch are anatomically related and explain why they are useful to us as
humans. Pay special attention to the fact that both taste and smell are
chemical senses, in that they give us information about the chemical
composition of our surroundings.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 10.5 hours to complete.
