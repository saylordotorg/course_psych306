**Unit 1: An Introduction to Sensation and Perception** <span
id="1"></span> 
*You might call the study of sensation and perception the study of
reality. When you take in and process sensory information, your brain is
creating a picture of reality that enables you to go about your daily
life, making decisions and performing actions. Over the course of their
evolution, the human brain and the sense organs that deliver information
to it have become increasingly adept at this. In this unit, you will
learn about the sense organs, the information that they pick up, and the
different ways the brain processes that information. We will also
discuss this field of study more generally, looking at its historical
development, its most commonly used methods, and a number of its current
theories.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 13.5 hours to complete.

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   describe the sensory systems, and distinguish between sensation and
    perception;
-   explain the primary functions of the five (5) primary
    sensory/perceptual systems;
-   describe the important evolutionary aspects of sensory/perceptual
    systems; and
-   describe the historical progression of thinking and research in
    sensation and perception.
