**Unit 7: Perceptual Development** <span id="7"></span> 
*In this final unit, we address one of the most interesting of all
topics in sensation and perception; that is, how do these processes
develop and change over our lifetime? It should be apparent that
perception both requires sensory experience and that it changes as past
perceptions influence how we respond to novel stimulation. The ultimate
point is that sensation and perception are not static mechanisms; they
are always in a state of dynamic flux, sometimes strengthening our
awareness of the world around us and sometimes causing interference.
Although these systems change over time, we are never more eager for
stimulation, nor more sensitive to potential harm, than in the first
years of life. Much of the research on perceptual development focuses on
this *“*critical period.*”

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 18.5 hours to complete.

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   explain the major issues in the “nature versus nurture” controversy
    as it relates to perceptual development;
-   describe the major developmental issues associated with each of the
    five (5) primary sensory systems; and
-   explain the relationships between perceptual and cognitive
    development.
